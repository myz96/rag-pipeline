In some cases, discounts/entitlements may apply if you \nmeet certain criteria we set. Any discounts/entitlements may be subject to rounding and \nonly apply to the extent any minimum premium is not reached. If you are eligible for more \nthan one, we also apply each of them in a predetermined order to the premium (excluding \ntaxes and government charges) as reduced by any prior applied discounts/entitlements. \nAny discounts/entitlements will be applied to the base premium calculated prior to any \ntaxes being added.", "2What cover \nyou get for \nyour vehicle\n(Not applicable \nif you have Third \nParty Property \nDamage cover)\u2022 Your vehicle (including its standard tools, modi\ufb01cations and accessories \nas supplied by the manufacturer and fitted or non-standard extras, \nmodifications and accessories which are included on your policy \nschedule) is covered for its agreed or market value whichever is shown \non your policy schedule.\nWhat we \npay for \n(where applicable)If we agree to pay a claim for covered loss of or damage to your vehicle \nwe will:\n\u2022 at our option (acting reasonably), repair or pay you the reasonable \ncost of repairs or the agreed value or market value that applies on the \npolicy; and\n\u2022 pay for other covered benefits that apply, subject to the relevant limits.\nWhat you \npay forIf you make a claim and are responsible or at fault for the accident, you \nwill be required to pay:\n\u2022 any amounts that might apply such as an excess.\nSummary of policy features, bene\ufb01ts and exclusions\nOur motor insurance policy has been designed to provide you with different types of cover \nto choose from.
