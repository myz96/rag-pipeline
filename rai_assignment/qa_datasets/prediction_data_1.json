To see what happens when a decision is being made on a repairer \nsee the section \u201cChoosing a repairer\u201d.\nPay you the reasonable cost of repairing your vehicle\nRather than repair your vehicle we can choose (acting reasonably) to pay you the \nreasonable cost of repairing it. If we choose this approach we will determine the reasonable \ncost by examining a number of factors. This may include the quote from your nominated \nrepairer and other repairers as well as reports from our trained assessors.\nWe may choose (acting reasonably) the approach of paying you the reasonable cost of \nrepairing your vehicle where we are not satisfied with the repairer you choose.\nPay your claim as a total loss\nWe may pay out your claim as a total loss when we consider your vehicle to be a total loss or \nwe choose to do so.

See page 72 for what happens when \nwe decide to repair your vehicle.\n2.   Pay you the reasonable cost to repair your vehicle\n   can choose to pay you the reasonable cost to repair your vehicle as \ndetermined by us. \n   We determine the reasonable cost to repair the damage by looking at a \nrange of factors. That may include quotes from your own repairer, quotes \nfrom NRMA Partner Repairers, our nominated repair methods for the type of \ndamage to your vehicle and reports from our assessors. \n3.  Pay your claim as a total loss\n   We may do this when we consider your vehicle to be a total loss or when we \nchoose to do so. Table 8.1 on page 68 shows what we pay for a total loss \ndepending on the type of insurance you\u2019ve chosen or cover you have.\n   If we pay your claim as a total loss, then your policy ends and you don\u2019t get a \nrefund of your premium. Table 8.1 on page 68 shows whether you keep your \nvehicle or we keep it.\n4.  Pay for other benefits\n   If we agree to pay you under any other benefits that apply, we will choose the \nmethod of settlement and repairer or supplier. \n   We may decide to repair or replace the loss or damage or pay you the \nreasonable cost of repair or replacement as determined by us. We only pay \nthe cost to repair or replace the loss or damage up to the maximum amount \nthat applies under a\u00a0benefit.\nWhat happens to your property\nRecovered vehicles\nIf we settle your claim as a total loss for a stolen vehicle which is later recovered, \nthen we usually keep your recovered vehicle.
